## Checking if attacking cop number minus cop number is 3

### Description

This project exists to compute the cop number of 18 graphs that are of interest to the author and his collabertors for research purposes. The particular graphs we are interested in are of the form H = G^2 - E where G = (V,E) is a $(3,9)-cage. This check is of interest because we are able to use it to show that there are graphs with attacking cop number 6 and cop number 3.
